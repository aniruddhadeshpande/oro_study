# Changelog

One entry per step: what changed, why, and the validation result.

## 2026-09-06 — Setup: agentic scaffolding

**What changed**
- Workspace tree created at repo root: `specs/ scripts/ runbook/ logs/ docker/ .claude/commands/`.
- `runbook/oro-commerce-architecture-runbook.md` moved from `docs/` (git mv, history preserved).
- `CLAUDE.md` — the spec's prime directives and anti-patterns as enforceable rules with triggers:
  a closed STOP-AND-ASK list with no standing grants, the `UNVERIFIED:` rule, the redaction rule,
  the evidence rule, Compose v2 only, and the consumers-mean-broken-not-partial rule.
- `specs/STATE.md` — durable resume point, read first by every phase command.
- `.claude/commands/oro-{spec,discover,plan,implement,validate,evidence,document,summary}.md` —
  one command per spec phase, each gating on the previous phase and carrying a `model:` field.
- `scripts/capture.sh`, `preflight.sh`, `validate.sh`, `magento-stack.sh`.
- `.gitignore` — excludes the `docker-demo` clone, all real `.env` files, and `logs/raw/`
  (pre-redaction scratch). Redacted logs are tracked: evidence is a deliverable.

**Why**
The spec is an instruction set with directives that erode across context compaction and session
boundaries — spec-before-action, one-step-at-a-time, approval before irreversible ops, no invented
facts. Encoding them as a governance file plus phase-gated commands plus an on-disk state file makes
the workflow the path of least resistance rather than something to remember.

**Validation**
| Check | Result |
|---|---|
| `bash -n` on all four scripts | PASS |
| Redaction: `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`, DSN userinfo, `api-key`, `Bearer` token through `capture.sh` | PASS — all `[REDACTED]`; `grep` finds no secret value in tracked `logs/` |
| `preflight.sh` idempotency, two consecutive runs | PASS — identical verdicts and exit code; only the live MemAvailable figure drifts (7344 → 7332 MiB) |
| `preflight.sh` on this host | GO — docker 28.3.3, compose 2.39.1, port 80 free, 7.3 GiB available, 328 GiB disk; note: 16 `docker_magento` containers up |
| `magento-stack.sh down -v` (guardrail) | PASS — refused, exit 64. The script has no path to `down`, `prune`, or `rm` |
| `validate.sh` with no stack present | PASS — exit 2 with "the stack has not been cloned yet (Phase 3 task 2)" |

**Not yet verified**
- Command phase gating (`/oro-implement` refusing an unapproved plan) — the commands load at session
  start, so this is checked on the next session, not this one.
- `validate.sh` checks 1–13 against a live stack — no stack exists yet by design.

**System state after this entry:** unchanged. Nothing was installed, started, or stopped.
